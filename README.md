project 2

#### Technology
I used CSS, JavaScript, bcrypt, dotenv, Ejs, Express, Express-session, Mongoose, and MongoDB to build this application.

#### Approach
Full CRUD app created first. Added login functionality second.

#### User Story
This app is a community based car database.

#### Notes
I want to add functionality so the user who adds cars is the only user able to make changes to the car listing. Improve mobile styling.
